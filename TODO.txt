Rearrange Decoder to match json.Decoder. That is, give it an io.Reader
from which it consumes bytes.

Todo
----

Done
----
     - Assume read blocks until io.EOF
     - Can return io.EOF
     - Should be able to get rid of the queue
     - Get calls parse which read io.Reader as needed
     - parse returns if a complete netstring is available. It does not
       loop around and create multiple netstrings.
     - Get rid of the notifier
     - Get rid of locking
     - Debug unmarshal
     - Replace Put with Encode?
Fix README.md
Marshal/Unmarshal examples in doc.go and README.md

Replace Decoder.Get() with Decoder.Decode() and GetKeyed with DecodeKeyed()
Then Marshal can use the same loop with GetKeyed() until eom or EOF.

Replace Encoder.Put* with Encoder.Encode*
